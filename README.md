# Calculator on web The Odin Project

the Odin Project calculator

what I've learned :

- set data-attribute to element and select element by data
- window.addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {})
- and a lot more...
  what I can do better:
- when we click an operator then the keyboard just ignore '0' number (but still accept the dot '.' and others number) because I just don't want to get divide by zero or do math with zero
- It need more test and fix
- and do two features 'percent' and 'minus'
- and a lot more...
